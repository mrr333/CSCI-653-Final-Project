# Asymmetric Carrier Dynamics in Ferroelectric van der Waals Layers
This is a readme file for Asymmetric Carrier Dynamics in Ferroelectric van der Waals Layers project.
## 0. Problem Description
- Functional layered materials (LMs) consisting of atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) layers are revolutionizing materials science. 

- LMs not only possess outstanding electronic, optical, magnetic and chemical properties but also offer the possibility of tuning these properties in desired ways by building vdW heterostructures composed of unlimited combinations of layers.

- Atomically thin vdW materials possessing ferroelectricity have promising applications in ultralow-power electronics. 

- A notable example is giant barrier-height modulation in a ferroelectric tunnel junction made of copper indium thiophosphate (CuInP2S6), which displays stable ferroelectricity down to atomic thickness and room temperature.

- While this modulation was ascribed to asymmetric electronic-band profile due to electric polarization, electronic dynamics underlying asymmetric carrier transport is largely unexplored.


## 1. Simulation Method
- Static Electronic Calculations: **Density functional theory (DFT) 

- Dynamic Simulations: **Non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NAQMD)** based on **time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)** at a temperature of **300 K** under the **canonical ensemble (NVT)



## 2. Expected Result
Simulations results exhibit a high asymmetry in carrier transport due to CIPS polarization, which is likely related to the observed tunneling barrier enhancement. Better understanding of the asymmetry in the charge carrier transport will give valuable insight into the design of novel ferroelectric tunneling junctions.
